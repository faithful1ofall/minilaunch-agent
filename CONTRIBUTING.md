## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define proper types for all functions and variables
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types from `lib/utils/types.ts`

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (`ChatInterface.tsx`)
  - Utilities: camelCase (`validation.ts`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow existing color scheme and spacing
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Test dark mode compatibility
- Use Framer Motion for animations

### API Routes

- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Validate input data
- Return consistent response format:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: boolean;
    data?: any;
    error?: string;
    message?: string;
  }
  ```
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add proper TypeScript types

### Comments

- Document complex logic
- Use JSDoc for functions:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Brief description
   * @param param1 - Description
   * @returns Description
   */
  ```
- Avoid obvious comments
- Keep comments up to date
